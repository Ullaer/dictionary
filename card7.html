    <p>The closest translations for metsänhoito are silviculture or forest improvement. However, the latter part of the finnish word — hoito — can also be translated as care or nurture. Does the forest need care or nurture? For what? What was the state of the forests before we looked after them?
    </p><p>Silviculture aims to produce more wood mass in a steady and efficient manner. Certain measures can enhance the growth of a forest and thus accelerate the natural sequestration of carbon.
    </p><p>After meeting the Finnish president Sauli Niinistö, Donald Trump got the impression that forest fires in Finland are prevented by raking and cleaning the forest floors, which is not quite how forest management is done.

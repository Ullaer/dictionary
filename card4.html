    <p>A windthrow means a tree fallen over by a strong wind. For forest owners it means economic loss, and they have often been collected soon after a storm to be sold. But for certain species, dead trees are essential as habitats.  For these species, it’s important to have enough rotten wood close by to survive.</p>

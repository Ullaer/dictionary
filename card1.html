    <p>Forest is an ecosystem consisting of living organisms, soil and climate, but also a place. As a matter of fact, we still don't understand how forests work at large, because they are such complicated and diverse systems. It has recently been discovered that soil has an even bigger role than we thought.
    </p><p>The forest industry has long been very important to Finnish economy. In 2020, the forest industries accounted for a fifth of the total turnover of all manufacturing industries. Forests didn’t always stand for just wood. The word <i>metsä</i> (forest) stood for the origin of any resource, you could go to a proverbial forest to get mushrooms, broom materials or even a wife.

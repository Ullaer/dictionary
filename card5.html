    <p>There has been a lot of talk about how Finnish forestry is sustainable, but also claims that it really isn’t. To get a better understanding one needs to define sustainability.
    </p><p>According to economist Kate Raworth, “sustainability is like a doughnut, where the inner circle contains the social foundation for a life of dignity and the outer circle shows the Earth’s carrying capacity. The challenge for the modern world is that, while not everyone’s human needs are fulfilled, other people are living beyond the capacity of natural resources. Sustainable development aims at human wellbeing within the carrying capacity of the Earth. This calls for the kind of economic development that takes account of both the limits of the Earth’s carrying capacity and the fundamentals of human progress and life.” This means that ecological sustainability is the foundation of sustainable development.
    </p><p>Sustainable development in Finland is tracked following the UN 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to Finland’s Voluntary National Review looking back at the progress achieved between 2016 and 2020 “Finland has almost reached the SDGs related to social and economic sustainability. Key challenges are related to consumption and production patterns, climate action and the state of biodiversity.” It also notes that “​​very little is known about the global impacts of Finland’s actions, i.e. spillovers, due to lack of adequate data.”

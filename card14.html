    <p>Forest scientist Gustaf Sir√®n studied why spruce forests in the north grow and renew themselves so slowly. His hypothesis was that forest fires or other natural disasters are needed for the renewal in the natural cycle, otherwise the dark and dense forest will slowly commit suicide, it will become a suicidal spruce copse. The concept became rooted in forestry for a long period, and was used to justify clearcutting.
    </p><p>It has since been proven a myth. Otherwise spruce should have gone extinct in most of Northern Finland.
